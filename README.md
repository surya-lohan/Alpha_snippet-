# Figma
we chose to use Figma for our project because of its collaboration features, ease of use, and  cloud-based platform allows real-time collaboration, which was essential for working with teammates and stakeholders. Everyone could view, comment, and edit designs simultaneously, making the design process much more efficient and transparent.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh\
  
# Tailwind css
 we chose to use Tailwind CSS for the utility-first approach allowed me to build complex designs directly in the HTML without writing custom CSS for every element. This made the development process faster and more efficient.

# Appwrite
For the backend of our project, we chose Appwrite for the offers a comprehensive suite of backend services that allowed us to quickly set up and manage authentication, databases, file storage, and more. This saved a lot of time compared to building these components from scratch.
